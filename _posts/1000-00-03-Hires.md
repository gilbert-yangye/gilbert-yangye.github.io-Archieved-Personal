Our research centers around automation, human-robot interaction, AI, and human-assistive technology. This cross-disciplinary journey has been and will be very interesting with exposures to cutting-edge technologies, 
including VR/AR, different morphs of robots (arm, hand, suit, quadrupedal, underwater, in-the-air), AI and machine learning, human physiological sensing... and more!

Ultimately, I wish to promote automation and reshape workforce in and beyond the civil engineering area with robots and human-centered AI. 

**If this future excites you, welcome to join**. I am recuiting **Ph.D. students** on rolling basis. Bachelors, masters, or visiting Ph.D. are also welcomed to work in our lab. 
Drop me an email at **gilbert.yangye@gmail.com** with your (1) CV, (2) cover letter, and (3) transcripts. 
Please highlight your qualifications and describe your motivation in your cover letter. 
A brief research statement (~ 1 page) stating a research problem of your choice and outlining your proposed approaches based on existing literature is recommended but not required.
