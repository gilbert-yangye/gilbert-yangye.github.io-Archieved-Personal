I am Dr. Yang (Gilbert) Ye. I will be joining **Northeastern University** as an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in January 2025. I am a researcher and engineer in the field of human-robot interaction and robotics for resilient infrastructures in civil engineering. 
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Civil & Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida under the supervision of Dr. Eric Jing Du. My research focuses on automation and workforce engagement in civil engineering with advanced robotics, 
human-centric artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction methods inspired by human sensorimotor processes. 
I  have published over 20 papers on top conferences and journals. I also serve as a reviewer in multiple journals such as Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 
Advanced Engineering Informatics, Computers in Human Behavior, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, and conferences. I am a member of ASCE, IEEE, and HFES.
