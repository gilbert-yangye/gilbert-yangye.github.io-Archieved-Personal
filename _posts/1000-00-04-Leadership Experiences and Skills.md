## Leadership Experiences

### Pilot Project 1: Automation of Structural Horizontal Joint Design and Regulation Verification.

During my internship at [**Beijing Institution of Residential Building Design & Research Co. Ltd, Beijing**](https://www.brdr.com.cn/), 
a significant aspect of my role was to ensure the structural integrity of designed buildings by performing structural simulations and calculations. 
One crucial process involved checking the design of structural joints to comply with local regulations. 
s each city had varying regulations, this manual process proved to be time-consuming.

Recognizing the potential for improvement, I initiated a pilot project with two senior structural engineers to automate this process. 
Despite none of us having prior programming experience, we collaborated to tackle this challenge. 
After conducting several pilot tests, I proposed a viable work plan. 
Our first step was to consolidate existing procedures and narrow down the list of regulations pertinent to our work. 
I then delved into the source code of our structural calculation software, extracting key parameters required for evaluation. 
By developing code that automatically extracted and applied appropriate equations for each regulation, we made significant progress.

Throughout this endeavor, I led the team in designing and implementing the automated system. 
My role involved coordinating efforts, offering guidance, and ensuring smooth collaboration among team members. 
The senior structural engineers rigorously tested the software under my guidance.

Upon successful completion and approval by my supervisor and the department head, I took the lead in 
organizing a workshop to train engineers in other teams on the effective use of this software. 
This capacity-building initiative not only enhanced the efficiency of our department but also fostered a collaborative culture within the organization.

Previously, the manual work procedure required approximately **2 days of effort for each round of design review**. 
However, with the automated solution that I spearheaded, this time-consuming process can now be completed with a **single click**. 
The final product contributes significantly to the overall productivity of our projects.
