Next, we gathered a group of passionate students who shared our vision and formed a cohesive project team. 
We drafted a comprehensive project proposal collaboratively, encompassing both local (HK) and global (UK) promotion sessions.
Each session included volunteer services, workshops, and Facebook hashtag challenges. Finally, we concluded the project with an exhibition.

I took the lead on organizing volunteer events and coordinating the global session itinerary, while actively participating in other project activities. 
Throughout the process, we encountered various challenges, including event promotion, volunteer recruitment, and coordinating logistics with NGOs and university clubs.
These challenges were further amplified during our visit to the UK for the global session.


With determination and close teamwork, we ultimately secured the funding award after numerous meetings and collaborative efforts with potential partners, 
including NGOs and university student associations. The successful acquisition of the prize marked the commencement of our organizing efforts.

Over the course of several months, we successfully executed all proposed activities and achieved our key success factors.
Our commitment to addressing the food waste problem left a lasting impact on both the local community and a global audience.

This project not only highlighted my leadership skills but also demonstrated my ability 
to organize and coordinate complex initiatives and activities. 
Overcoming challenges with resilience and ingenuity, 
I took charge of coordinating diverse activities, ensuring their smooth execution and impactful outcomes.

_Schematic drawing retrieved [**online**](https://www.eng-alliance.com/services-eng-aliance/civil-structural-engineering/structural-analysis-design) for demonstration purposes_


During my internship at [**Beijing Institution of Residential Building Design & Research Co. Ltd, Beijing**](https://www.brdr.com.cn/), 
a significant aspect of my role was to ensure the structural integrity of designed buildings by performing structural simulations and calculations. 
One crucial process involved checking the design of structural joints to comply with local regulations. 
s each city had varying regulations, this manual process proved to be time-consuming.

Recognizing the potential for improvement, I initiated a pilot project with two senior structural engineers to automate this process. 
Despite none of us having prior programming experience, we collaborated to tackle this challenge. 
After conducting several pilot tests, I proposed a viable work plan. 
Our first step was to consolidate existing procedures and narrow down the list of regulations pertinent to our work. 
I then delved into the source code of our structural calculation software, extracting key parameters required for evaluation. 
By developing code that automatically extracted and applied appropriate equations for each regulation, we made significant progress.

Throughout this endeavor, I led the team in designing and implementing the automated system. 
My role involved coordinating efforts, offering guidance, and ensuring smooth collaboration among team members. 
The senior structural engineers rigorously tested the software under my guidance.

Upon successful completion and approval by my supervisor and the department head, I took the lead in 
organizing a workshop to train engineers in other teams on the effective use of this software. 
This capacity-building initiative not only enhanced the efficiency of our department but also fostered a collaborative culture within the organization.
I was awarded **Elite of the Season 2018** to reward the success of the project.

Previously, the manual work procedure required approximately **2 days of effort for each round of design review**. 
However, with the automated solution that I spearheaded, this time-consuming process can now be completed with a **single click**. 
The final product contributes significantly to the overall productivity of our projects.

### Pilot Project 2: Workflow automation in annual database maintenance and update
`July 2017 `{: .filepath}

`Role: Team Leader`{: .filepath}

![Desktop View](/images/Leadership/cloud-database.png){: width="200" height="200", .right}

 During my internship at [**C&H Properties**](https://www.bing.com/search?q=c+%26+h+properties+singapore&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&lq=0&pq=c+%26+h+properties+singapore&sc=10-26&sk=&cvid=36144D6A39D94E44A8E6E500D1595E44&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=),
 I identified a time-consuming database maintenance and update workflow, 
 wherein employees had to manually search online for agent information and update the firm's database. 
 With approximately 50,000 entries, this task required one employee to dedicate more than **six weeks** of effort. 
 Recognizing the potential for improvement, I proactively sought and gained the endorsement from my supervisor to lead a pilot project aimed at enhancing this workflow.

To initiate the project, I conducted several meetings with senior staff to develop a comprehensive work plan. 
After carefully defining the inputs and desired outcomes, I took the lead in coding a sophisticated web-scraping program. 
Working closely with a senior staff member, we ensured the program's compliance with copyright regulations. 
The iterative process of reviewing, debugging, and optimizing the program was a collaborative effort that I orchestrated within the team.

To validate the program's efficacy, I invited an external staff member to conduct thorough testing and compare the automated results with manual efforts. 
The outcomes demonstrated that the program was not only robust but also proficient in accurately capturing errors. 
Moreover, the quality of its output surpassed that of manual labor.

As the final step, I packaged and presented the program, providing a clear demonstration of its functionality. 
We implemented the program into the actual dataset, resulting in a remarkable improvement of the process. 
What used to be a continuous and labor-intensive **six-week** endeavor was now accomplished with a **single click**.

Throughout this project, my leadership played a pivotal role in driving the team towards success. 
My ability to coordinate and guide team members, combined with a detail-oriented stategy, ensured the seamless design and execution of the software program. 
The project's success not only expedited database maintenance but also demonstrated my passion and ability for delivering innovative and impactful solutions.
