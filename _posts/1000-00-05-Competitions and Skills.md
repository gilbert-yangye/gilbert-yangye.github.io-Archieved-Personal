We formed a team with me working for the engineering design. After two-week intensive design meetings, we came up with a final design and won 
the engineering award.


The Witters competition is a design and engineering challenge that seeks to uncover cutting-edge, sustainability-focused, 
and community-centric planning, design, and construction solutions for the redevelopment of the decommissioned fire station in downtown Gainesville.

I invited friends to forme a team, in which I worked for the engineering design. 
Over two weeks of intensive design meetings, we harnessed our collective creativity and expertise. 
We meticulously crafted a final design that exemplified innovation, functionality, and sustainability.
Our design stood out among the submissions, earning us the engineering award.

### Kaggle Computer Vision Competition: The Identification Game 2020

At Imperial College London, I teamed up with motivated classmates to participate in a Computer Vision (CV) competition 
focused on classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset. 
We leveraged our diverse strengths to work on different steps, modelling different architectures, and combined for the best-performing architecture.
Through experimentation, we fine-tuned our models, achieving impressive accuracy and winning the competition.

### World Mandarin Debating Championship 2018

As an elite member of the Mandarin debate team at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, 
I had the honor of representing the university in numerous debating competitions. 
One of the most significant events was the World Mandarin Debating Championship in 2018, 
where I actively participated in two matches. Thanks to the exceptional teamwork of my fellow teammates, we emerged victorious in both debates.

Participating in debating competitions proved to be an exhilarating and challenging experience, 
as we were tasked with advocating for opinions randomly assigned to us. 
The intensity of the competition demanded quick thinking and the ability to 
construct and dismantle arguments within tight time constraints. 
Effectively communicating complex ideas and reacting promptly were essential skills that players had to master.

These competitions offered valuable learning opportunities, 
allowing me to grow both personally and intellectually. 
The exposure to diverse perspectives and the constant need to adapt and refine our arguments 
honed my critical thinking and persuasive communication skills. 
Moreover, the friendship and support within the team fostered a sense of unity and shared purpose, 
contributing to our success and leaving a lasting impact on my development as a debater.
